# Jupyter Notebooks
This is a repo containing few of my jupyter notebooks covering different topics.

**Machine Learning**

* [TicTacToeQlearning](https://github.com/nicopi/ml-notebooks/blob/master/TicTacToeQlearning.ipynb): Implementation of a Q-learning agent that learns how to play Tic Tac Toe by playing several matches vs a random player

* [MNIST_CNN](https://github.com/nicopi/py-notebooks/blob/master/MNIST_CNN.ipynb): Convolutional neural network (CNN) performing image classification of the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.



**Others**

* [COVID-19 Italy data visualization](https://github.com/nicopi/py-notebooks/blob/master/COVID19_ITA_plots.ipynb): Visualization of the data about the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy.

* [Elephant](https://github.com/nicopi/py-notebooks/blob/master/Elephant.ipynb): John von Neumann once said "With four parameters I can ﬁt an elephant, and with ﬁve I can make him wiggle his trunk". Is that true?
